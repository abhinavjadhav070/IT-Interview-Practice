When a new element enters at index $i$:\n\n1. We pop all elements from the back of the deque that are $\\le nums[i]$.\n2. We push index $i$ onto the back.\n3. We evict the front index if it has fallen outside the window $[i - K + 1, i]$.\n\nBecause each index enters and exits the deque at most once, the total operations across the entire array is bounded by $2N$, delivering strictly $O(N)$ runtime.`

For two-pointer problems (e.g., Trapping Rain Water, 3Sum, Container With Most Water), formulating the invariant eliminates off-by-one errors completely.\n\n### The Invariant Recipe\n\n1. **Initialization**: State what is guaranteed before entering the loop (e.g., $left = 0, right = n-1$).\n2. **Maintenance**: Prove that moving the pointer with the smaller boundary never misses a strictly larger volume candidate.\n3. **Termination**: When $left \\ge right$, all potential candidates have been exhaustively tested.`

Project Loom changed this with Virtual Threads.\n\n### When to Beware of Carrier Thread Pinning\n\nVirtual threads unmount from carrier OS threads during blocking I/O (\`Socket.read()\`, \`Thread.sleep()\`). However, carrier threads remain **pinned** if blocking occurs inside:\n\n1. \`synchronized\` blocks or methods (Use \`ReentrantLock\` instead).\n2.
